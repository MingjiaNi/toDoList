The webpage is currently using html5 local storage to storage to store all the infomation. There is an upper limit of 5 MB (You won't be able to use it up). If your browser doesn't support html5 local storage, cookie will be used as a substitution (upper limit is 4095 bytes). All the cookie will expire after 1 year.
